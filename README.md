Application description:

This application provides the user with a GUI that allows them to perform the following:

- Create, update, and delete appointments that are stored in a SQL database.
- Create, update, and delete customers that are stored in a SQL database.
- View a 'Reports' screen that allows the user to filter how many appointments there are for a selected month and appointment type.

Other functionalities of the program:

- If there is an upcoming appointment within 15 minutes of when the user signs in, a notification saying so will appear upon signing in.
- Depending on the user's computer language settings, the application will be in either English or French. If the settings are not set to French, the default is English.
